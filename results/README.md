# Results for Faults Attacks on Grain-128AEAD

This directory consists of the results or materials that are used in the experiment of the paper titled **_Random Differential Fault Attacks on the Lightweight Authenticated Encryption Stream Cipher Grain-128AEAD_** 

The experiments were done using [SageMath](https://www.sagemath.org/). 

## Visual Basic Programmes ##
* `ColorDuplicate.vb` - color duplicated values of output indices in a range of cells (in matching colors)
  
* GetAbsoluteUnique.vb 
  * color a range of cells based on values 
  * can be used in single or move values in a cell

## Excels ##
1. `Moderate Control Results`
   * Results obtained by calculating the output differentials of single and pairs of outout indices 

2. `Moderate Control Unique Values -Evaluation`
    * The process of evaluating the conclusive bit or pairs of output indices for the corresponding register in LFSR byte

3. `Moderate Control Signature for Each Byte`
    * Final results of the moderate control fault attack on Grain-128AEAD
